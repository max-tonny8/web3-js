# Web3 By Example
Node.js with Web3 javascript example scripts for getting basic information (transactions, balances, ether, and tokens) from the Ethereum blockchain.

## What Is?
I'm not a developer. However I really wanted to get into how to write code that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain, being one of the more interesting blockchain projects I figured it would be a good place to learn how to use the infamous "blockchain" in a website or just in the console using some javascript.

This proveed to be quite the challenge, as previously stated I'm not a developer. Googling found some good examples, but a lot of what I eneded up with was more or less code I wrote. Now that being said, any professional ~~might~~ will notice my code isn't perfect. Orignially I was going to make a Medium artcile with all this, but having someone help or rather fix errors would be WAY easier on Github... so here we are.

## Running Scripts
You will need to install the following before you can run any of the scripts. It's also worth noting that while I did run all these scripts with a fully sync'd Geth node, I've replaced the connection in all the scripts to use an Infura API as well. This was done so that it would be easier for folks to run these as all they'd need to install would be Node and the Web3 module.

- Node.js (8.7.0)
- Web3 Module (1.0.0)
- *OPTIONAL* Geth (1.7.1 or the latest version)

To execute you simply use the console in run ```node example-script.js``` and the results will be printed in the console.

## Additional Notes
Web3 1.0.0 is at the time of this edit, beta. I actaully have no idea why when I installed it it chose to use the beta version, probably an error on my part. That being said, it does work so while it may not be ideal for production it should suit the needs of someone who just wants to learn and run a few scripts. 

I really did want to make a webiste with these and have the results show up on the page, but the effort was too much for me plus my javascript ability was not up the task. 

Again, not a developer. If there is something wrong with what I wrote here or with a script, please call me out on it or request to change it. I hope this is able to help othe newbies learn more about Ethereum and the only way thats going to happen is with help from more compitant developers.
